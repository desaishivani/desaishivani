## 🚀 Projects  

### [Stress Detection from Social Media](https://github.com/desaishivani/stress-detection)  
**Objective:** Built a classification system with BERT embeddings and XGBoost to detect stress from textual data with 94% accuracy.  
**Implementation:**  
- Preprocessed text data and balanced labels using SMOTE.  
- Visualized patterns through topic modeling (SVD) and word clouds.  

### [Algorithms for Speed Bump Detection](https://github.com/desaishivani/speed-bump-detection)  
**Objective:** Designed a Faster R-CNN-based system to detect speed bumps with high precision.  
**Implementation:**  
- Addressed dataset imbalances through augmentation.  
- Evaluated model performance using IoU and AP metrics, improving robustness.  

### [Customer Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/desaishivani/customer-segmentation)  
**Objective:** Analyzed customer personality data to identify distinct segments for targeted marketing.  
**Implementation:**  
- Performed k-means clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
- Categorized customers into "Impulsive Spenders," "Loyal Customers," and "Surfers."
