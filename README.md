Let's turn data into impactful solutions together! 📊✨  

## 🚀 Projects  

### [Stress Detection from Social Media](https://github.com/desaishivani/Stress-Detection-from-Social-Media)  
**Objective:** Built a classification system with BERT embeddings and XGBoost to detect stress from textual data with 94% accuracy.  
**Implementation:**  
- Preprocessed text data and balanced labels using SMOTE.  
- Visualized patterns through topic modeling (SVD) and word clouds.

### [Classify Song Genres from Audio](https://github.com/desaishivani/Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data)  
- **Objective:** Created a machine learning pipeline to classify audio tracks into genres with 92% accuracy.  
- **Implementation:** Utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction and optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

### [Algorithms for Speed Bump Detection](https://github.com/desaishivani/Deep-Learning-Project)  
**Objective:** Designed a Faster R-CNN-based system to detect speed bumps with high precision.  
**Implementation:**  
- Addressed dataset imbalances through augmentation.  
- Evaluated model performance using IoU and AP metrics, improving robustness.  

### [Customer Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/desaishivani/Customer-Segmentation)  
**Objective:** Analyzed customer personality data to identify distinct segments for targeted marketing.  
**Implementation:**  
- Performed k-means clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
- Categorized customers into "Impulsive Spenders," "Loyal Customers," and "Surfers."
